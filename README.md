### General Information / Behind the scenes.

This map was a fun little adventure to make, i focused primarily on giving the Rocket Launcher and Grenade Launcher to the player, and giving the Thunderbolt either later or through the earlier secret.

The original idea stuck through, just a "tons of enemies" map, not sure if it qualifies as slaughter or horde... but had fun.

I converted the OLLLLA textures from Doom to Quake, just did recolor of the green one to make it as a close as possible to Green, since Green is a color difficult to achieve within Quake color palette.

The song used was already finished when the speedmapping activity was announced, in the last day of it i added 2 basses (making a bassline to keep it mysterious but catchy).

I thank all my friends and people around the quake community for playing the map, also Pacifist Paradise community!

I thank Stricker17 for pointing me out some corrections in the song used in the map.

Best vibes and best wishes for everyone!

Excelsior!


### Special thanks

A special shoutout to Ribbiks and dannebubinga for making Sunlust (Doom wad) as it's aesthetic and a bit of difficulty dynamics have inspired my mapping skills in a sort of way. <3

A special tribute mention to my friend Meowgi from the Doom Community for helping me for mapping into doom, leading Pacifist Paradise community and never stopped believing in me.  <3
